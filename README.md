## **Basic Usage**
1. Install the required libraries by running ***pip install -r requirements.txt***.
1. Run ***train.py*** to train our model. (This will take some time approx. 4 hours)
2. After training ends, run ***tensorboard --logdir="logs"*** to view the Huber loss as specified in the LOSS parameter, the curve is the validation loss. You can also increase the number of epochs to get much better results.
3. Run ***test.py*** to test the model and to output the result

Note: the project is currently running on GitHub Actions, you can take a look at the example output down below. GitHub Actions allows the code to be ran offsite hence freeing up your development computer.
